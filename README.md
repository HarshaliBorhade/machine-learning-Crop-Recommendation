## Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** analyzes factors like soil properties, weather conditions, and rainfall to recommend the best crops for cultivation. It leverages **logistic regression** for classification and evaluates its performance using various metrics.

This tool is designed to:
- Assist farmers in optimizing their crop yields.
- Provide insights into environmental trends affecting agricultural productivity.
- Promote sustainable farming practices.

## Features
- Predicts the most suitable crop for given conditions.
- Visualizes data insights using bar and scatter plots.
- Utilizes logistic regression for classification.
- Generates evaluation metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.
- Provides probabilities for predicted outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:
- **N**, **P**, **K**: Soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).
- **Temperature**: Average temperature of the region.
- **Humidity**: Average humidity of the region.
- **pH**: Soil pH level.
- **Rainfall**: Average annual rainfall.
- **Label**: The target variable indicating the recommended crop.
